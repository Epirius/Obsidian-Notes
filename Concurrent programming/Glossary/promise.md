a value that i don't have right now, but will have in the future

a promise can be in one of three states:
	- pending: promise has no value yet
	- fulfilled: the asynchronous operation has completed, and the promise has a value which will not change
	- rejected: the operation failed, and the promise will never be fulfilled
