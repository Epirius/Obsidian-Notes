We have mentioned time complexity, but we can also analyse the computational resources used by an algorithm, such as: 
- memory (space)
- power usage
- bandwidth
- time
- [[lock|locks]]
- file handles
- etc

Develop a mathematical theory of complexity.
in general, time is always >= space, other resources.
hence we will focus on time complexity.
We don't run out of time, but we do run out of space.
