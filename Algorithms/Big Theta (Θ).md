Big Theta is a combination of [[Big O]] and [[Big Omega (Ω)]]. so it both upper and lower bounds the given function

```
Def (Θ). f(n) is Θ(g(n))
if there exists constants c1 > 0, c2 > 0, n0 >= 0
such that for all n >= n0,
c1 g(n) <= f(n) <= c2 g(n)
```

```
f is Θ(g)
if and only if
then f is O(g)
and f is Ω(g)
```

f = g if and only if f <= g and f >= g
