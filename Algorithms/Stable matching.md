a stable matching algorithm is an [[Algorithm]] that match to sets, where each item in each set has a preference list for who they want to match with in the opposite set.

for example a set of men and a set of women who each has a preference for who they want to match with of the opposite sex.


a stable matching algorithm would match all items in the sets in such a way as to maximize preference.

an [[unstable matching]] algorithm would be an algorithm where if one item finds a better match, this would result in lots of other matches braking up because each of the items in the other matches might find a better match.
