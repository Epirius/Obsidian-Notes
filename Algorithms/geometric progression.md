(Sum from j=0 to N) q^j is called [[geometric progression]]

q < 1:   (Sum from j=0 to N) (1/2)^j   <   2
q = 1    (Sum from j=0 to N) 1^j         =   1
q > 1    (Sum from j=0 to N) 2^j         =   exponential growth


if q < 1 then sum is constant
if q = 1 then the sum is Θ(n)
if q > 1 then the sum is Θ(q^n)
