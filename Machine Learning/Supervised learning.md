the learning algorithm i given objects and labels to learn from.
the goal is for the learning algorithm to learn the mappings from objects to labels, and to be able to label objects it has not seen during training.

example: handwritten digit classification.

#machine-learning 


Task: predict labels of new, unseen objects
performance measure: prediction accuracy or error
experience: object-label pairs
classification: predict categorical labels
regression: predict real-value labels
