a simple model will not be able to fit the training data perfectly.
by adding a bias we have more options for how to fit the data




- bias: error due to modeling assumptions
- variance: error due to variation in the training set
- simple models tend to have high bias and low variance
- complex models tend to have low bias and high variance
- goal: low bias and low variance

bias = the target we are aiming for
variance = the spread around the target

generalization error = bias^2 + variance + irreducible error
