as opposed to [[Supervised learning]], unsupervised learning is not given object label pairs, only objects.

the learning algorithm has to find patterns in the given data-set on its own.
this learning strategy is used in for example [[Clustering]] data points.

Unsupervised learning can suffer from [[Overfitting]] if it is trained to much.
