if a object learns its training data to well, it may do worse on new data then if it was not trained as much.

#machine-learning 


def: a model performs well on training data but [[Generalization|generalizes]] poorly

potential causes:
- noise  (irrelevant information or random data)
- to flexible (complex) model
- to little data


we know we have overfitting when there is a high training score, but low validation score
